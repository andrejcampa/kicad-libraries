# LIST OF KICAD GITHUB-HOSTED PCB FOOTPRINT LIBRARIES
#
# Place this text into your fp-lib-table file to add these Github-hosted PCB footprint libraries to KiCad.
#
# You can omit a library by placing a '#' at the start of that particular line.
#
# Each library is listed twice. The first line is for when you want read-only access to the library.
# If you also want to modify the footprints in the library, then comment the first line and
# uncomment the second line. You must also create a local directory for storing your modified
# footprints at the location listed in the options field. You can place this directory anywhere 
# you want, but its name has to end with ".pretty".
